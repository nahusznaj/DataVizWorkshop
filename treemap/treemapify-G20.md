### Drawing a simple treemap
In a treemap, each tile represents a single observation, with the area of the tile proportional to a variable. Let’s start by drawing a treemap with each tile representing a G-20 country. The area of the tile will be mapped to the country’s GDP, and the tile’s fill colour mapped to its HDI (Human Development Index). geom_treemap is the basic geom for this purpose.
<pre><code>
ggplot(G20, aes(area = gdp_mil_usd, fill = hdi)) +
  geom_treemap()
</code></pre>

This plot isn’t very useful without the knowing what country is represented by each tile. geom_treemap_text can be used to add a text label to each tile. It uses the ‘ggfittext’ package to resize the text so it fits the tile. In addition to standard text formatting aesthetics you would use in geom_text, like fontface or colour, we can pass additional options specific for ‘ggfittext’. For example, we can place the text in the centre of the tile with place = "centre", and expand it to fill as much of the tile as possible with grow = TRUE.
<pre><code>
ggplot(G20, aes(area = gdp_mil_usd, fill = hdi, label = country)) +
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_text(fontface = "italic", colour = "white", place = "centre",
                    grow = TRUE)
</code></pre>

### Subgrouping tiles
geom_treemap supports subgrouping of tiles within a treemap by passing a subgroup aesthetic. Let’s subgroup the countries by region, draw a border around each subgroup with geom_treemap_subgroup_border, and label each subgroup with geom_treemap_subgroup_text. geom_treemap_subgroup_text takes the same arguments for text placement and resizing as geom_treemap_text.
<pre><code>
ggplot(G20, aes(area = gdp_mil_usd, fill = hdi, label = country,
                subgroup = region)) +
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_border() +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_text(place = "centre", grow = T, alpha = 0.5, colour =
                             "black", fontface = "italic", min.size = 0) +
  geom_treemap_text(colour = "white", place = "topleft", reflow = T)
</code></pre>

Note that ‘Argentina’ has been hidden. geom_treemap_text will hide text labels that cannot fit a tile without being shrunk below a minimum size, by default 4 points. This can be adjusted with the min.size argument.

Like any ‘ggplot2’ plot, ‘treemapify’ plots can be faceted, scaled, themed, etc.
<pre><code>
ggplot(G20, aes(area = gdp_mil_usd, fill = region, label = country)) +
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_text(grow = T, reflow = T, colour = "black") +
  facet_wrap( ~ econ_classification) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    title = "The G-20 major economies",
    caption = "The area of each country is proportional to its relative GDP
               within the economic group (advanced or developing)",
    fill = "Region"
  )
</code></pre>

### Animated treemaps
The default algorithm for laying out the tiles is the ``squarified`` algorithm. This tries to minimise the tiles’ aspect ratios, making sure there are no long and flat or tall and skinny tiles. While ‘squarified’ treemaps are aesthetically pleasing, the downside is that the position of tiles within the plot area can change dramatically with even small changes to the dataset. This makes it difficult to compare treemaps side-by-side, or create animated treemaps.

By providing the ``fixed = TRUE`` option to ``treemapify`` geoms, an alternative layout algorithm is used that will always position the tiles based on the order of observations in the data frame. It’s very important that the same value for fixed is passed to all ‘treemapify’ geoms, otherwise different layers of the plot might not share the same layout.

With the help of ``fixed = TRUE``, and with the tweenr and gganimate packages, it becomes possible to create animated treemaps showing e.g. change over time.

<pre><code>
library(tweenr)
library(gganimate)

G20_alt <- G20
G20_alt$gdp_mil_usd <- sample(G20$gdp_mil_usd, nrow(G20))
G20_alt$hdi <- sample(G20$hdi, nrow(G20))

tweened <- tween_states(list(G20, G20_alt, G20), tweenlength = 8,
                        statelength = 5, ease = 'cubic-in-out', nframes = 31)

animated_plot <- ggplot(tweened, aes(area = gdp_mil_usd, fill = hdi,
                                     label = country, subgroup = region,
                                     frame = .frame)) +
  geom_treemap(fixed = T) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(fixed = T) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_text(place = "centre", grow = T, alpha = 0.5,
                             colour = "black", fontface = "italic", min.size = 0,
                             fixed = T) +
  geom_treemap_text(colour = "white", place = "topleft", reflow = T, fixed = T)

animation::ani.options(interval = 1/10)
gganimate(animated_plot, "man/figures/animated_treemap.gif", title_frame = F,
          ani.width = 200, ani.height = 200)
animated_treemap
