Part G: The ggplot() Command
 The command ggplot() initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to
declare the input data frame for a graphic.
 It can also be used to specify the set of plot aesthetics intended to be
common throughout all subsequent layers (unless specifically
overridden).
 Important: The actual plots are built with subsequent commands.
 ggplot() is typically used to construct a plot incrementally, using the
+ operator to add layers to the existing ggplot object.
 This is advantageous in that the code is explicit about which layers are
added and the order in which they are added.
 We can define common aesthetics using the aes argument for this
command.

###Aesthetics
 Aesthetics are attributes that can be perceived on the graphic.
 Size, shape and colour are all examples of aesthetics.
 Each aesthetic can be mapped to a variable, or set to a constant value.

###Geoms
Points, lines and bars are all examples of geoms (geometric objects)
Geom Named Plot
point Scatter plot
point Bubble chart (relationship of size to variable)
bar Bar chart
boxplot Box-whisker plot
line Line chart

Geom_smooth
 Basic scatterplot seen previously. Add a “smooth” geom to the plot
 The “smooth” layer fits a smooth trend line through the data.
 The stat fits the data to a loess smoother, with semi-transparent ribbon
for representing standard error.
 We will use qplot() for the time being.
>
> qplot(mpg,wt,data=mtcars)+geom_smooth()
>
Warning Message
geom_smooth: method="auto" and size of largest group
is <1000, so using loess. Use 'method = x' to change
the smoothing method.

Additional Example (using faceting)
>
>qplot(mpg,wt,data=mtcars, facets = .~am)
+geom_smooth()
>
(Notice the range of x-values on both subplots are the same)
TOG and Dublin R ggplot2 workshop October 2012
Using ggplot()
 Start off in similar manner to qplot().
 The function ggplot()only creates a data object. Let us call it P.
 There is no graphic yet. Try out summary() on the object.
 Add layers to the data object to build up plot.
 We specify the data set and using the aes argument, the variables and a
subcategorization by cylinder.
P = ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, colour=factor(cyl)))
summary(P)
Summary output of P
data: mpg, cyl, disp, …… vs, am, gear, carb [32x11]
mapping: x = mpg, y = wt, colour = factor(cyl)
faceting: facet_null()
Add the first layer
 Both of the following commands are equivalent.
>P + geom_point()
>P + layer(geom="point")
TOG and Dublin R ggplot2 workshop October 2012
Add a second layer
Lets join the dots ( probably not useful in this particular case)
>P + geom_point()+ geom_line()
>P + layer(geom="point") + layer(geom="line")

Linear Regression ( entire data set )
 Let’s use two different variables, with no sub-setting.
 Apply a simple linear regression model fit to the data.
> ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy))
+ geom_point()
+ geom_smooth(method="lm")
TOG and Dublin R ggplot2 workshop October 2012
Linear Regression ( using grouping )
Use a stat instead of geom (equivalent) in this case.
> ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy,colour=factor(cyl)))
+ geom_point()
+ stat_smooth(method="lm")
TOG and Dublin R ggplot2 workshop October 2012
Linear Regression ( using faceting )
> P = ggplot(mpg,aes(displ,hwy))+ geom_point()
+ stat_smooth(method="lm")
> P+ facet_grid(.~cyl)
 facet_grid(cyl ~ .)
 More or less the same graph, but on top of each other.
 Can adjust scales!
TOG and Dublin R ggplot2 workshop October 2012
Add an additional layer with different mapping
P + geom_point() +
geom_point(aes(y=disp),colour="darkblue")
 Strange plot: Faceting is useful for situations like this
TOG and Dublin R ggplot2 workshop October 2012
Adding statistics to your plot
>
>qplot(mpg,wt,data=mtcars)+stat_smooth()
>
 Same plot as before.
 stat_smooth() equivalent to geom_smooth() and
geom_ribbon() by default
 Use different geoms: Points and Error bars(probably bad idea)
>
>qplot(mpg,wt,data=mtcars)+
stat_smooth(geom="point") +
stat_smooth(geom="errorbar")
>

### Geoms and Stats
 Geoms always have default statistics associated with them.
 Stats always have default geoms associated with them.
 Many are interchangeable (e.g. smooth and boxplot)
TOG and Dublin R ggplot2 workshop October 2012
Boxplots
>ggplot(mpg,aes(class,hwy))+ stat_boxplot()
> ggplot(mpg,aes(class,hwy))+ geom_boxplot()
