Midwest demographics
=========================

Demographic information of midwest counties from 5 US states


(June 2018: Make sure to use the development version of ggplot2 for this exercise.)


```{r}

# 1. For this exercise we will use the following R packages


library(ggplot2) # Development Version
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

# 2. Load the data set and carry out some preliminary analysis

data(midwest)

  # Preliminary Analysis Functions

head(midwest)
class(midwest)
names(midwest)
help(midwest)

# 3. Import the USA counties shape file
UScounties <- sf::read_sf("USA_adm2.shp") 

  # some More Analysis

head(UScounties)
class(UScounties)
names(UScounties)
help(UScounties)


# 4. Matching up the two data sets by State - Part 1

table(midwest$state)

table(UScounties$NAME_1)

# 5. Get rid of non-relevant columns

table(UScounties$ID_0)
table(UScounties$ISO)
table(UScounties$TYPE_2)
table(UScounties$ENGTYPE_2)
table(UScounties$NL_NAME_2)
table(UScounties$VARNAME_2)

UScounties <- UScounties %>% select(-c(ID_0,ISO, NL_NAME_2))


# 6. Subset it to midwest states using dplyr

MWcounties <- UScounties %>% filter(NAME_1 %in% c("Ohio","Michigan","Indiana","Wisconsin","Illinois"))


# 7. Lets see how things match up

dim(midwest)
table(midwest$states)

dim(MWcounties)
table(MWcounties$NAME_1)

table(MWcounties$ENGTYPE_2)


# 8. Lets Join the tables. Some work to do first

  # Add state column to MWcounties using a Lookup table

statecode <- data.frame(
   NAME_1 = c("Ohio","Michigan","Indiana","Wisconsin","Illinois"),
   state  = c("OH", "MI", "IN" ,"WI", "IL")
   )

   # Carry out a "SQL Join" operation

MWcounties <- left_join(MWcounties,statecode)

   # can get rid of statecode dataframe now 

   # Lets clean up the dataframe using dplyr::select

MWcounties <- MWcounties %>% select(1:NAME_1,state, NAME_2 , everything())

   # Also  - get rid of Water features

MWcounties <- MWcounties %>% filter(ENGTYPE_2 != Water body")


head(MWcounties)

  # So Far So Good


# 9. Put the counties names in the same case ( arbitrarily - all upper case)
 
 # Lets check midwest data set

head(midwest$county)
head(MWcounties$NAME_2)

midwest$county    <- toupper(midwest$county)
MWcounties$NAME_2 <- toupper(MWcounties$NAME_2)

# 10. Lets Join the tables

  # First Lets do some checks!!

full_join(midwest, MWcounties, by= c("state"="state", "county" = "NAME_2")) %>% dim()

inner_join(midwest, MWcounties, by= c("state"="state", "county" = "NAME_2")) %>% dim()

anti_join(midwest, MWcounties, by= c("state"="state", "county" = "NAME_2")) %>% dim()

anti_join(MWcounties, midwest,  by= c("state"="state", "NAME_2" = "county")) %>% dim()

  # How many problem cases have we?
  # May Have to fix them manually

# 11. Sort both data sets by state and county name and then do some checks

midwest <- midwest %>% arrange( state,county)
MWcounties <- MWcountues %>% arrange(state,NAME_2)

mean(midwest$state == MWcounties$state)

sum(midwest$county == MWcounties$NAME_2)

sum(midwest$county != MWcounties$NAME_2)

 #  Alphabetial order is broken

# 12. OK lets fix it with "gsub"

 # A Basic understanding of regular expressions is recommended

midwest$county <- gsub("ST ","SAINT ",midwest$county)

midwest$county <- gsub("DU","DU ",midwest$county)

midwest$county <- gsub("LA","LA ",midwest$county)

```
