Part C : Quickplot
==============================
- The quickplot function `qplot()` is supposed to make
the same sort of plots as `ggplot()`, the main function offered by
the ggplot2 package, but with simpler syntax.


- However, in practice, for more complex plots, it is probably more straightforward to use `ggplot()`.
- Many of the arguments supplied to R’s plotting command `plot()` (e.g.
main, xlab, ylab etc) can be supplied to `qplot()`, and processed the
same way.

#### Motor Trend Car Road Tests
This data set was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and
comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and
performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

The basic syntax of the command is
<pre><code>
qplot(x.var,data=dataset.name)
</code></pre>

```{r}
qplot(mpg,data=mtcars, binwidth=2)
```

```{r}
qplot(mpg,data=mtcars, geom=c("histogram"),
binwidth=2)
```

#### Subsetting
Those familiar with the mtcars dataset would be aware of other (categorical )
variables. For example
- cyl : number of cylinders (4, 6 or 8?)
- vs : (binary variable)
- am : Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) 

First we will subset by colour, using the am variable

```{r}
qplot(mpg,wt,data=mtcars, colour=am)
```

We can now use the plot to make some deductions about whether or not
being automatic or manual has a bearing.

#### Using different aesthetic mappings - size
We can scale the glyph in terms of size, depending on which level of a variable they belong to. We will use a different variable this time.
```{r}
qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars, size=qsec)
```

```{r}
qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars, shape=factor(cyl))

```
